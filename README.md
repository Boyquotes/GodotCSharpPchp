# GodotCSharpPchp

GodotCSharpPchp is a repository aimed at integrating PHP scripting support into the Godot game engine using the C# scripting language.

## Description

This project provides a bridge between PHP and the Godot game engine, allowing developers to write game logic using PHP within the Godot environment. By leveraging the C# scripting capabilities of Godot, this integration enables the use of PHP scripts alongside other game scripts written in C#.

Please note that this integration is experimental and not officially supported by the Godot Engine project.

## Installation

1. Clone this repository to your local machine.
2. Copy the necessary files into your Godot project's directory.
3. In the Godot editor, configure your project to use the C# scripting language.
4. Write your game logic using both C# and PHP scripts.

## Usage

To utilize PHP scripting within Godot, follow these guidelines:

1. Create a PHP script file with the extension `.php` in your Godot project's directory.
2. Write your PHP code in this script file, making use of the provided API functions.
3. From your C# game scripts, you can invoke PHP functions and access PHP variables using the provided API.
